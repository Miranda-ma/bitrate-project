# This file contains a list of link change events to execute in the simulated
# network. Columns are as follows:
#
# <time> <ip1> <ip2> <bandwidth> <latency>
#
# time: time (in seconds) after the previous event that this event should run
# 		Floats are ok. The character '*' indicates the event should wait to
#		run until the user presses enter.
#
# ip1, ip2: The IP addresses of the endpoints whose "link" you with to modify.
#			Order is not important.
#
# bandwidth: The BW to set. Should include unit (e.g., 1mbit or 500kbit)
#
# latency: The artificial latency to impose on the link. Should include unit
#		   (e.g., 200ms or 1s)

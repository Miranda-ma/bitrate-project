\begin{enumerate}

	\item Video bit rate adaptation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Server (provided by us) serves manifest and multiple copies of the video file encoded at different bit rates
		\item Students implement a proxy that sits between our server and a stock video player.
		\item The proxy measures the BW it's getting from the server and requests the appropriate encoding.
		\item We can use click to artificially vary the BW/latency between the proxy and the server.
	\end{itemize}

	\item DNS Load balancing??
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Students launch multiple instances of the video servers
		\item Students implement a simple DNS server that uses round robin to return a video server's IP address
		\item This sounds really easy. Worth making them do it?
	\end{itemize}

	\item Routing among servers???
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If we need more meat, we could bring back a piece of the old project 2, where servers don't necessarily have all video chunks.
		\item A set of video servers run OSPF among themselves to figure out how many hops they are away from each other
		\item Each video server gets a subset of the media files
		\item The students' proxy requests a video file from a ``master'' server; if that server doesn't have the file, it forwards the request to the closest server that does.
	\end{itemize}
